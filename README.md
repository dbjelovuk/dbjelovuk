Hello, my name is David!  I use he/him pronouns.  I am currently working on becoming a programmer/software developer.  I am looking for assistance getting started in this new world, as this is my first time exploring a career in tech.  Please ask me about my two dogs, cooking, or ballroom dancing!  Fun fact: I am exploring new career opportunities after working in Hospitality for nearly 20 years.  Looking forward to connecting and collaborating with my Cohort.  Cheers!
